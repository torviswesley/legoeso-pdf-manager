== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get started? =
* Downpload, install and activate the Legoeso PDF Manager on your WordPress site.
* Locate 'Legoeso PDFâ€™s' within the admin menu.
* Select or drag your documents to the drop area.  

= How do I include my PDF documents in my post = 
* Simple. Just include the shortcode [legoeso_display_documents] within your page. You can display your PDF documents on any page by using any of the shortcodes listed in the Legoeso Settings admin menu. There are three (3) "types" of views that can be used.

= Is there a file size limit? =
The plugin has no file size limitation, however, your web hosting provider may have limitations, such as the maximum number of files that can be uploaded at one time, the maximum file upload size and the maximum memory that can be allocated to a PHP script. In cases of large documents, only a preview image will be generated, no text will not be extracted from the document, therefore the document's text will not be included when performing keyword searches. 

= Why wasn't there a text preview after I uploaded my document?
If no text could be detected from the document only a preview image will be shown.  This is also true for large documents with many pages, only a preview image of the document will be generated.

The Legoeso PDF Manager stores your PDF documents within the WordPress upload directory.
