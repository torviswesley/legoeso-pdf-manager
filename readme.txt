= Is there a file size limit? =
The plugin has no file size limitation, however, your web hosting provider may have limitations, such as the maximum number of files that can be uploaded at one time, the maximum file upload size and the maximum memory that can be allocated to a pHp script. In cases of large documents, only a preview image will be generated, no text will not be extracted from the document, therefore the document will not be included when performing keyword searches. 
In addition a document's text will not be extracted from a document that has too many pages.

= Why wasn't there a text preview after I uploaded my document?
If no text could be detected from a document only a preview image will be shown.  This is true also for large documents with many pages, only a snap shot of the document will be generated.

The Legoeso PDF Manager stores your PDF documents within the WordPress upload directory
